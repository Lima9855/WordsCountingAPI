# WordsCountingAPI

SpringBoot application that provides one REST endpoint for text analysis. The result of the analysis is a list of all words that are in the loaded text (without repetitions). 
Next to each word, the number of its occurrences in the text and the information which word it was in turn.
The program is omitting commas, full stops and other punctuation marks and whitespace in its work. The words are listed in alphabetical order.
